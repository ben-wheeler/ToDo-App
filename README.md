# ToDo-App
![Welcome](https://imgur.com/bZuMmQo.jpg)
My first ever personal project! A simple mobile application built using Swift and SwiftUI. 

The goal of this was to create an Applicaiton for managing a To Do list built with persistent data storage, and custom class implementations though Core Data. The app allows users to create to-do items and toggle between a due date or time. Each to do is tracked from creation date, till the due date with a live progress bar representing elapsed time until due.

A quick and basic walkthrough of the app and its features
## Future of App 
It has Multiple features, such as tagging, and potienally a calander will be added as I progress my skill level. Eventual Goal is to be able to get the App to a finished state, ready for an App Store Release
